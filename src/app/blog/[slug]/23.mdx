Well since I've got some down time, I'm going to be working on rebuilding this site. Instead of running on a container, I think I can turn this whole thing into a static site. I'm going to use NextJS and Evergreen UI for the site stack, which may or may not be something that was maybe used by my previous team at eBay. Actually, even if that was hypothetically the case I didn't end up having a lot of exposure to that particular maybe project so this'll give me some glimpse into that.

Anyways I've started some progress into it, and it's been pretty good so far. Evergreen has some quirks to it but I think overall I like all of this much better than the Ruby on Rails setup from before. Not that there is anything too wrong with Ruby on Rails but Rail's ERB template definitely feels outdated compared to React. And I just wanted to upgrade things to a bit of a more modern stack. Funny how I'm going full circle from static pages to web server back to static pages.

The more complicated parts are coming up next for me, where I'll need to fetch all the data from the database then turn them into markdown pages. That's how I plan to go. Basically markdown everything and then to add new pages I would check into the repo and redeploy. CMS was an option but idk, I feel like that might be overkill + I don't want to have to worry about another dependency. I'm probably going to deploy to Amplify.
