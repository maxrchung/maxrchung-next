I'm gonna be starting a new job soon that uses Ruby on Rails, so as part of
re-learning that, I'm going to be revisiting some of my (I guess now really old)
work done on this site. Where possible, I'll also try and update the site to be
better and shinier.

Yesterday, I added in HTTPS support, courtesy of Let's Encrypt. I also updated
all of the server packages and gems. Updating everything led to some... errors,
but I think that's all sorted out now. Next, I may take a look at styling, maybe
adopt a random new CSS framework to try things out. Bulma looks interesting.
