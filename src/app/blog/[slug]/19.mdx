I redid the navbar and refactored a lot of my CSS stylesheets with SASS. Bulma's pretty interesting. It seems like a lighter weight Bootstrap and works/looks pretty good out of the box. I like that it's CSS-only, and I think CSS frameworks should aim to be that. Bootstrap's jQuery dependency can make it kind of heavy and sometimes weird to work with in a JS framework. Bulma may be a bit too numbed down for me though, I miss having bloated CSS utilities everywhere to make my life easier.

We'll see, but I may do more deep diving with Bulma and overhaul more parts of this site. A lot of my existing posts are using custom CSS classes I previously made though, so these will probably have to stay intact.
