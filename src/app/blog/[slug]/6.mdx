Alright, it's been two weeks since my last update, and things are going a lot
slower than I expected. Apparently I didn't realize how much effort it would
take to make project write ups. Even the posts where I just transferred over
from my old site took a lot of effort because I do a proofread over once or
twice that somehow takes half a day. So far I've got about a dozen up that I'm
alright with. I think I still have another dozen maybe to go.

Later today I'm going to try and just get this site up as soon as possible
regardless of my write up status. I'll just copy over what I have from the old
pages and work from there. It'll give me something to look forward to rather
than just struggling to chug out words over and over. I just want to finish all
this as soon as possible. I'm basically not doing any programming/studying right
now, and I feel myself rusting away without practice.

I'll also test audio really quick.
