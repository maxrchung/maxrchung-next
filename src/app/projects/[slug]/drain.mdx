This was an osu! storyboard requested by [fartownik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/56917) and based on one of my favorite songs, Drain by ELECTROCUTICA and Luschka. The storyboard showcases a number of different effects, including: generated rotoscope, drawn lyrics, poetry, dots, splatters, drips, and 3D-ish camera movement.
