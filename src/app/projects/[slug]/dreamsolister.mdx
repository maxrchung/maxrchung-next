This was a collab osu! storyboard project made for DREAM SOLISTER, the opening song of Hibike Euphonium. It took over 2 years of on and off work to complete my parts as each section had custom scripting, utilities, and painstakingly hand-placed shapes. The theme of this storyboard centered around building everything with only 4 primitive shapes: rectangles, triangles, circles, and semicircles.
