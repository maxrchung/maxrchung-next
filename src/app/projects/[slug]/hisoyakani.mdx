This storyboard project converts a Blender 3D animation to triangle sprites. I'm
happy with the results but damn do I feel exhausted. It's definitely been
difficult for me learning and finding motivation to do 3D modeling and
animation. And then having to figure out some funky 3D math to tie everything
together, amazing time, just amazing, just amazing, just amazing.
