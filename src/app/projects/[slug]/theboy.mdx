The Boy is a long running project that's pretty much evolved into my personal
brand and identity. Originally, it was a one-off digital picture I drew back in
highschool. But one thing's led to another and now I am Him.

I was debating even if I should put this as a project since it's not very
software related. Honestly this is more than a joke than a real thing. But
alright, here and now I officially declare this as a project. Most of this is
just custom art pieces that I've bought here and there. Not much of it required
work from myself.

Also, since I guess I am web developer or I guess frontend engineer might be
better sounding, I'm going to create some kind of gallery-like component for all
my media posts. Might as well take advantage of React now that I've [upgraded my
site](https://maxrchung.com/projects/maxrchungnext). Also might as well do this
since I'm kind of laid off right now and should probably do some frontend
exercises. ü§™

Before I start, I'll just note that I'm not entirely sure if I'll be really
maintaining this page. Most of the stuff on here are just reposted from my
[Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/maxrchung). Maybe every once in while I'll sync
the two together, but ideally I'll probably just be posting to Twitter.

Kind of pointless, but

## Origin

Right, so let's first talk about where all this came from before seeing my
beautiful gallery that I'll definitely make. I think it was some year around
2011 that over the summer I was doing digital art. Back then I did a lot of
digital art in my free time. It was fun for me but somehow I ended up growing
out of it. These days I don't draw or do any art really at all.

I'm not really sure why. I guess I had a dream of going eventually into some art
career and doing art as a full time job, but that never really panned out as I
focused more on software and web development. I don't think I regret my path too
much. I certainly like doing what I'm doing now, and I think given my
temperament it's probably better that I ended up as an engineer than an artist.

There's just something about art that I never really got over the hump of. What
I mean is that, I didn't feel like I progressed at the right rate I wanted
despite putting in a lot of time and effort. Maybe with the right
setting/teaching/mentorship, things could be different but I think it's better
to look at the overall picture. Pick something to do that I not only have a lot
of passion about but have some talent and knack for. That's what I think
frontend is to me and what's different than art.

Well okay enough introspection. So it's sometime in 2011, and I was doing some
art at home. Here's what I eventually drew:

<Image src={s3("the-boy/origin-2011.jpg")} />
<Caption value="The Boy in the Mirror" />

Okay honestly, looking back on my [DeviantArt
page](https://www.deviantart.com/shrackner/art/The-Boy-in-the-Mirror-251767803)
for this, it's definitely a bit cringe for me. But I think it's still kind of a
unique style. I have a bit of a mixed feeling of my old drawing days. It's not
like I'm ashamed of it because I know at the time that I really enjoyed it and
really invested myself into it, and I'm not going to invalidate those feelings.
But man some of the pieces I did back in that era are a little embarrassing to
look at now.

Anyways yes, this is actually a self portrait. The original title was "The Boy
in the Mirror" because it's literally me in the mirror. I just drop the mirror
part for this project now so the title's a bit shorter. This picture was taken
in my room in my family home. The room is for the most part unchanged. Maybe
some things are slightly moved around. The chair is still there. I actually
still have the pants. But the shirt got too worn out over the years so I
eventually got rid of it. The headphones broke at some point.

If I had to critique myself, I'd say it's actually not that bad and kind of
cool. Okay which is kind of weird because I was just cringing 2 paragraphs ago.
But I think the more I look at this and get over my feelings, it's pretty
interesting. It's definitely different than the kind of anime style I drew at
the time but I wanted to try out a style of coloring head edges.

So to make this kind of style I basically did a ton of Pen tool work in
Photoshop. Everything is basically just pen tool selecting and layering over
stuff and then coloring in selected sections. I think some of the shading is a
little bit overdone like the hand section is a little crazy compared to some
more tamer parts, but overall I'd say I really like this effect. That being said
I don't think I ever made another picture in this style after this.

One compliant I have though is that the window is definitely not to proportion.
I think if the guy were to stand up he would probably be taller than the top of
the window. It's just bad perspective that I never adjusted for. I kind of suck
at perspective stuff. Oh yeah I wanted to also mention the framing. The framing
is actually the outer edge of my sliding closet door. The closet door has a
mirror over it so that was where I was looking.

Right so then after that nothing really happened for a long time. If I remember
correctly, I showed the picture to some friends and they thought that it was
maybe a bit funny but that was pretty much it. It seems like it wouldn't be
until I think 7 years later that I revisited this. I think I was looking to
switch my profile picture that I used for games after a while.

I used to use the picture below for a variety of online accounts way back in the
day. I really liked this hair over eye headphones scarf kind of anime look. This
was a super old one, looks like uploaded Nov 2010. The nice thing was thing was
that I didn't have to draw hands or half the face so it was just mostly black
and yellow blobs.

Ok then at some point I was browsing through vocaloid music and somehow
somewhere I ended up listening to someone named
[RUBY-CATMAN](https://vocadb.net/Ar/3396), what a name. I have no clue how I
stumbled upon his music but it's really unique and good. I think generally all
his songs are upbeat, more happy sounding electric pop kind of tunes with Miku.
He's super underrated, and I recommend all his songs. I don't know he's still
producing stuff.

Anyways I was browsing through his music videos and there was one for Êú™Êù•„ÉÜ„É¨
„Éù„Éº„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ (translated: Future Teleportation). There is a split second of
the video where Miku has a funny gorilla like head, and I just found it
hilarious. So for a while I used this headshot as my profile pictures.

Fast forward to probably 2018, I wanted to change my profile picture again.
People use profile pictures for different reasons and for me I guess I wanted it
to be something not only representative of me but also something I personally
created. So thinking about some of my old pictures, this one came up, and I
figured why not let's crop the head out and see how that looks.

<Image src="/the-boy.jpg" />

This face expresses many things. I think he has a very stoic, focused, and
relaxed, but also judging expression. It is me, and I did create it so why not
use it as my profile picture everywhere. So I pretty much did that and updated
all my online socials and accounts to using it. The only place I don't really
use it is maybe LinkedIn, but I'm seriously debating whether to change that too.

Sometimes it can be hard to decide what I want to separate from personal and
online life. Especially usernames, I don't really know sometimes what I want to
use there. These days I like to go by WAXCHUG as a funny joke name for some
online games, but I went by S2VX for a while since that was an important project
of mine, and I think a pretty cool name with history. But I also use maxrchung
in some places.

After changing my profile everywhere, my friends and I started using the face as
an server emote pretty much as a meme. On Discord it was added as
:daBOiindaMrrr:. Then slowly, sometimes within days, weeks, months, I started
collecting newer and newer pieces of The Boy merchandise until I have what I
have now.

At this point I could probably go into indepth details about how every new The
Boy addition was made, but I think I want to avoid going too deep. I like making
these free form posts but it takes a lot of time, a lot of typing, and there's a
reason why I haven't done these for like the past 3 or 4 years or something. I'm
going to try something a little different and make a customized gallery of sorts
to showcase all my The Boy things.

## Gallery

I moved the gallery to the top of the post since I think that's probably where
others (and probably I too) would like to more easily see it. I'll maybe write
more in this section once I'm done because it's been pretty interesting building
the gallery so far.
