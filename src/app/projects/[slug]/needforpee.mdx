Need for Pee is a 3D visual novel horror pee game about needing to pee at a
convenience store. Made in 3 days over MLK weekend. I did the majority of 3D
assets and environment layout. This was probably my first decent attempt at 3D
art for a game jam (RIP
[killer-self](https://maxrchung.com/projects/networkingwhyisitblackkillerself)),
pretty happy with how it turned out. Although there were a lot of assets, they
were mostly just simple 3D models and texturing, maybe next time I'll try
animation.
