Need for Pee is a 3D visual novel horror pee game about needing to pee at a
convenience store. Made in 3 days over MLK weekend. I did the majority of 3D
assets and environment layout. This was probably my first decent attempt at
doing 3D art for a project, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
