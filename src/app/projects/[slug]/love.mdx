This was an osu! storyboard centered around 3D lyric effects. I wanted to get some exposure into Blender but had quite a lot of trouble motivating myself to learn it. This project was kind of a jump start for me to get into Blender without overwhelming myself with modeling and that whole domain. I think it's been a good experience overall, pretty proud of how this turned out and hope I can continue to push myself to learn and develop further.
