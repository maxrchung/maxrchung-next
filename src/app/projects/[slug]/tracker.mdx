This was a simple exploration project where I wanted to try and make a
productivity app for myself to track my progress on various things (gym, goals,
etc.). I tried to experiment with some AWS related technologies like [Cloudscape
design](https://cloudscape.design) and [Amplify
backend](https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/set-up-graphql-api/). I also looked into trying out a few interesting/modern libraries like Vite and Zustand.

- Made with: React, Cloudscape, Vite, Zustand, Amplify

Overall, the tech was interesting but my idea kind of sucked. It felt pretty
nice to easily deploy things with Amplify. There are definitely some rough spots
but I think Amplify is continually improving to address issues, e.g. better
typing and better support for DB schemas I wanted to use. Docs and online
support are a bit of a mess with different instructions depending on what era of
Amplify questions are asked in. I'm excited though to see where Amplify goes in
a few years and wouldn't mind picking it up for another spin down the line.

As for my idea sucking yeah I kind of deployed it and never used it once lol. So
much for actually tracking things. You used to be able to access it at
[https://tracker.maxrchung.com](https://tracker.maxrchung.com) but I recently
ran into a problem with Google OAuth, don't really want to fix it, don't use the
site, so I'm just going to undeploy it and save a few cents.

I may update this later in life, dunno, but I kind of forgot mostly everything
already lol and it's only been a year.
