skr is like a skribblio/draw-my-thing clone made over a weekend jam. It is fully
multiplayer by the power of socket.io and websockets. You can make/join lobbies
and draw/guess pictures with others. By the way, this only really works on
desktop. Mobile is gonna have a bad time.

- Made with: React, HTML Canvas, socket.io
