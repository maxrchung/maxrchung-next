Hey, I'm Max. I'm a software engineer. These days I'm particularly interested in
frontend stuff. Something about bringing visuals and experiences to life sparks
a certain joy in me. My expertise is mainly in web development, but on the side
I also dabble in game, cloud, and animation related programming.

Outside of work, I'm probably cooking up some kind of side project. It could be
a game, website, or sometimes an [osu!
storyboard](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Storyboard). If I get the chance to, I
love working with others to make some wacky stuff. Occasionally I organize small
game jams or projects, but it can be hard to find time these days to manage
things.

If I'm not doing any of that, I'm probably at the arcade playing mostly dance
games like Dance Dance Revolution, Pump It Up, and StepManiaX. If I'm not doing
any of that that, I'm probably playing games at home, or watching anime, or I
hope eating/sleeping.
