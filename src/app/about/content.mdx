# About

<Image src="/about-max.jpg" width={256} borderRadius="100%" />

I'm a software engineer. Specifically, I like working on frontend. There's just
something about bringing visuals and UX to life that gives me a certain spark of
joy. I'm most proficient in developing web frontends, but I also dabble in some
game, cloud, and animation programming on the side.

Outside of work, I'm probably cooking up some kind of side project. It could be
a game, website, or sometimes an [osu!
storyboard](https://maxrchung.com/projects/tegami). If I get the chance to, I
love working with others to make some wacky stuff. Sometimes I organize small
game jams or projects, but it can be hard to find time and motivation these
days.

If I'm not doing any of that, I'm probably at the arcade. I've been playing a
lot of rhythm games and getting into Dance Dance Revolution, Pump It Up,
DrumMania recently. If I'm not doing any of that that, I'm probably playing
games at home, or watching anime, or I hope eating/sleeping.
